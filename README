         Hem - persistent ssh connection and tunnel manager

Hem manages multiple background SSH connections using an `ifconfig` /
`rc` style interface. It is most often used to setup persistent /
long-running port tunnels and control master connections. Hem monitors
connection upedness and can automatically bounce downed connection.

Hem is Free Software covered by the "New and Simplified BSD License". It
was originally written by Ryan Tomayko <rtomayko@gmail.com>.

Please read the file INSTALL for installation instructions. Hem should
run on most flavors of Unix and GNU that include a posix compatible sh
interpreter. Hem currently requires OpenSSH's ssh(1) as well as Carson
Harding's autossh(1).

More information on Hem is accessible from http://tomayko.com/src/hem/
including full documentation, examples, and distributables. There is
also project tracking resources at http://github.com/rtomayko/hem/
