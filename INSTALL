For most systems, you should be able to just do `make` then `make
install`. By default, the program is installed to `$HOME/bin`. You
can override the various install locations by passing them along the
`make` command line. For a global install, try:

        $ make prefix=/usr/local            ;# as yourself
        # make prefix=/usr/local install    ;# as root

After installing, reference the hem(1) manpages or dive right in
with:

        $ hem init --help

You can also use `hem` from its working directory without
installing. First, run `make` and then setup your PATH as follows:

        $ PATH=`pwd`:$PATH
        $ export PATH

See the README file included in this distribution and the hem(1)
manpage for information on hem usage.
