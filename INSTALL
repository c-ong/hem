For most systems, you should be able to just do the usual:

        $ ./configure
        $ make
        # make install      ;# as root

By default, the program is installed to `/usr/local/bin`. You
can override the various install locations by passing them along the
`make` command line. For a home install, try:

        $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME
        $ make
        $ make install

After installing, reference the hem(1) manpages or dive right in
with:

        $ hem init --help

See the README file included in this distribution and the hem(1)
manpage for information on hem usage.

If you'd like to hack on hem, the easiest way is to run configure with
the --development option and then put the working directory on your PATH:

        $ ./configure --development
        $ make
        $ PATH=`pwd`:$PATH
        $ export PATH

You will need to run `make` after changing any of the source files to build
the executable versions. There's also an `make auto` target that loops forever
and makes all every second.

The --development option basically sets up PREFIX and BINDIR to point to your
working copy.
